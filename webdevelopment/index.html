        <p>Growing up blocks a part, in the suburbs of St. Louis County their paths rarely crossed; not until a chance encounter Courtney’ senior year of high school. During the reception of a mutual friend’s wedding, Matt asked Courtney to dance. Five years later they were married, and they scoured the surrounding areas for land to start a farm. Visiting a near perfect property in Dittmer left them with the realty of farm ownership. Spanning over 150 acres, Lone Elm Farm is surrounded by forests, creeks, and a beautiful, white home built with the hands of its dedicated owners. Matt and Courtney could see their future before their eyes. 
        Archiving the success of MC Grodie Farms will not only benefit communicating their story, but it will also document its journey for their future generations of farmers.</p>
