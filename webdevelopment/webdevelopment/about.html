    <h3>MPH, MCHES</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Amanda, and I am starting my journey with Information Science and Learning Technologies. As a Mizzou alumna, I am familiar with the online learning and activities on Canvas. I have been teaching online for many years as an adjunct instructor with the University of Missouri Kansas City School of Nursing and Health Studies. Last August, I joined the Bachelor of Health Sciences Department as an Assistant Professor. While teaching my same courses, I have taken on additional courses to my workload as well as additional department responsibilities. I look forward to how the ISLT program can improve my teaching with online learning. 
    By the December of 2027, I plan to earn a Master of Science in Learning Technologies and Design. Pursuing this advanced degree will make me into a better educator.
    <br>On a personal note, my loving husband Geoff and I have three beautiful kiddos. Our tiny humans still require a lot of our energy and attention. In my spare time, I enjoy sinking into mystery novels, frenzied attempt to gardening, and creating unique art.</p>
