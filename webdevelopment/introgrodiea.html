     Hello! I am starting my journey with ISLT from Topeka, Kansas. I have been teaching online for many years with UMKC. As a Mizzou alumna, I am familiar with the online learning and activities on Canvas but thatâ€™s as far as my computer or web skills go. It would be too embarrassing to admit how long some of the practice for this class took (ha, kidding, sort of).

I look forward to how the ISLT program can improve my teaching with online learning.

In my spare time, I enjoy sinking into mystery novels, attempting (poorly) to garden, and creating unique art.
