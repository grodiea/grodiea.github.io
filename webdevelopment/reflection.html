    <h1>Generational Farming</h1>

  <h2><em>You been farmin' long?</em></h2>
<div class="intro">
<p>As soon as he could barely see over the steering wheel, Matt started hauling hay
bales in the back of his dad’s rusted out Ford F-150 from the field to the barn on the
family farm. Before long, he was behind the wheel of the family tractor. Bailing hay
is a slow methodical process so Matt quickly learned how to maneuver the gears
and how to switch equipment. While hay season is a time-consuming portion of
farmers’ summers, it is only a small portion of their responsibilities.</p></div>
<div class="intro2"> 
   <p>Alongside his dad, Matt also learned how to care for livestock. At a young age, he
learned about life and death. A few times, he needed to aid his dad in the birth of
cattle when mother cows were unable to deliver independently. He also witnessed a
well-loved cow be euthanized by the veterinarian when she was too sick to recover.
He was also present to wrangle squealing newborn piglets needing to get tagged
and vaccinated. Nearly every farm experience, Matt was there learning alongside his dad.</p>
<p>In 2012, a farm they previously toured officially became theirs. Shortly after, they
changed the name from Lone Elm Farm to MC Grodie Farms. Starting a family was
another dream for Matt and Courtney. Raising children on their own property came
was inevitable; because as a third-generation farmer, Matt has farming in his blood.</p>
<p>Matt’s mom bought a precious picture of two young boys, sheepishly looking at
one another with the text “you been farmin' long?” One of the young boys
resembled her son and she knew Matt's dad dreamt of his son continuing the legacy of farming. That picture hung in the basement of Matt's parent’s home until Matt moved in with Courtney. Little did his
mom know that her purchase of this picture nearly 40 years ago would beprominently displayed on the wall of her son’s home; surrounded by acres and acres of farmland. To answer the question: yes, because farming is in our blood.</p></div>
