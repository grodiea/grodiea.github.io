          <p>The purpose of this website it to collectively showcase my professional journey. This includes my prior work experiences, educational achievements, and volunteer opportunities. My goal for this website is to connect my public health world with my new discipline. June 2025 starts my journey with the School of Information Science and Learning Technology. I am eager to display my progress in the Master of Science in Learning Technologies and Design program here. This will be a platform for my two disciplines to intersect.</p>
